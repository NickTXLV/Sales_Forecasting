# Sales Forecasting
We have weekly sales data from annual 2019 and 2021. 2020 will not be used due to the impacts of Covid. The task is to make a forecasting model to predict weekly sales/demand for annual 2022 for each product.

The Steps that I will follow in this project:

1)Graph the data to understand it

2)Data Munging (Cleaning/Fill in missing values)

3)Regraph the data to understand it post data munging

4)Forecast all products

5)Save the model
